GUARD (Generic Unpacking with API Restoration and De-obfuscation) temporary repository.

As part of the submission (double-blind review), we would like to share the source files, executable files, experiment files, and results for review purposes. 

We believe that providing access to these materials will enhance the evaluation process and enable a better understanding of the work presented in the paper.

To facilitate the review, we have prepared the following items for submission:

Source files, Experiment Files and Results.

We believe that sharing the source code after acceptance will provide the research community with a deeper understanding of the underlying implementation and enable further exploration and collaboration.

Please let me know if there are any specific guidelines or instructions regarding the submission of these files. 

If you prefer a particular method of file sharing or have a designated platform for code review, kindly inform me, and we will promptly comply with your requirements (unlockable7@gmail.com).

Thank you for considering our submission and for your attention to this matter. We are eagerly looking forward to the opportunity to present our work.
